# Clients

The clients block represents a list of IPTV clients. Each client typically corresponds to a single device or user
accessing the IPTV service. Clients are identified by their unique name and authenticated using a secret key.

## Client Links

Each client can access the following endpoints:

- `{public_url}/{client_secret}/playlist.m3u8`
- `{public_url}/{client_secret}/epg.xml`
- `{public_url}/{client_secret}/epg.xml.gz`

## YAML Structure

```yaml
clients:
  - name: ""
    secret: ""
    proxy: {}
    playlists: []
    epgs: []
```
